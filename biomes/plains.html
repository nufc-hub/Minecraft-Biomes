        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Minecraft, the "Plains" biome is one of the most common biomes in the game
           and is characterized by its flat terrain and grassy landscape.<br> This biome 
           typically consists of large expanses of grassy fields, with an abundance of 
           flowers and occasionally some scattered trees.</p>
             <h3>Ecology</h3>
             <p>The weather in the Plains biome is generally sunny and mild, which makes it a 
                good place to set up a base camp or build a farm. The grass in<br> the biome is tall 
                and yellow, and there are also many flowers that can be found here.</p>
                <p>The Plains biome is also home to many different types of mobs, such as cows, 
                    pigs, sheep, and chickens, which can be farmed for their<br> resources. The biome 
                    also spawns horses, which can be tamed and ridden.</p>
                    <h3>Mobs</h3>
                    <p>The Plains biome in Minecraft is home to a variety of mobs. Cows can be found 
                        grazing in the grassy fields of the Plains biome. They can be milked for milk 
                        and their meat can be used for food. These mobs are passive and will not 
                        attack the player unless hit first.</p>
                        <p>Pigs can also be found roaming the Plains biome. They drop pork when killed 
                            and can be ridden with a saddle. They are also passive mobs and will not 
                            attack the player unless hit first.</p>
                            <p>Sheep can be found grazing in the grassy fields of the Plains biome. 
                                They can be sheared for wool and their meat can be used for food. 
                                Like the other mobs, sheep are passive and will not attack the 
                                player unless hit first.</p>
                    <h3>Trivia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One of the most distinctive features of the Plains biome is the presence of "Tall Grass" 
                            which is a type of grass that can be found on the Plains<br> biome and other 
                            biomes, it is taller than regular grass and can be used to hide mobs or the player.</li>
                            <li>The Plains biome is one of the largest biomes in Minecraft, and it generates
                                 more frequently than other biomes.</li>
