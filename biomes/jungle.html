        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In Minecraft, the Jungle biome is known for its dense vegetation, lush forests, 
            and unique mobs. It is characterized by its tall trees, leafy canopy, and 
            thick undergrowth.</p>
                 <h3>Ecology</h3>
                 <p>The Jungle biome also has a large variety of flowers, ferns and tall 
                    grass, and a lot of vines hanging from the trees.</p>
                    <p>The Jungle biome generates a different type of trees called 
                        "Jungle Trees" which are taller and more dense than regular 
                        trees, they also have a different leaf pattern. The Jungle biome 
                        also generates "Cocoa beans" which are a type of plant that can 
                        be found on the Jungle Trees.</p>
                        <h3>Mobs</h3>
                        <p>The Jungle biome is home to many unique mobs, such as Ocelots 
                            and Parrots, which can be tamed and trained to follow 
                            the player. The biome also spawns Jungle-specific mobs, 
                            like Jungle Pigmies, which are small and hostile mobs 
                            that spawn in groups, and Jungle Bats, which are passive 
                            mobs that spawn in caves.</p>
                            <h3>Trivia</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Jungle biome is one of the few biomes that 
                                    generates "Cocoa Beans" which are a type of 
                                    plant that can be found on the Jungle Trees. 
                                    These beans can be harvested and used to make 
                                    various items, including Dyes, cookies and cake.
